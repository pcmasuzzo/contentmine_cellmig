# contentmine_cellmig
This repo is meant to keep track of tasks, issues and overall progress of the ContentMine project.

I am one of the 2016 fellows, and you can read a description of my project [here](https://contentmining.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/introducing-fellow-paola-masuzzo-mining-the-literature-to-understand-cell-migration/).
The main idea is to mine open access literature around **cell migration** studies, to understand the divergence of nomenclature in the field, and construct a set of minimal reporting requirements based on ontologies and controlled vocabularies.

Main achievements of this project will be shared with the web through the [ContentMine blog](https://contentmining.wordpress.com).
